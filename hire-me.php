                    <p>Are you a founder who needs to focus on the bigger picture, or a leader of a company that requires senior product expertise without the full-time commitment? I partner with businesses as a fractional product leader to install effective product strategies, lead high-performing teams, and deliver measurable results. 
                    </p>
                    <p>My goal is to provide the strategic oversight and hands-on execution you need to move your product forward, exactly when you need it most.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="headline">How I Can Help You</h2>
<p>My experience is broad, covering everything from early-stage startups to scaling mature products in global organisations. Here's how I can apply that expertise to your business:</p>

<h3 class="sub-headline">Shape Your Product Strategy & Roadmap</h3>
<p> If you lack a clear direction, I can help define a compelling product vision that aligns with your business goals. We'll build and refine a product strategy and create an actionable roadmap that your entire team can rally behind </p>

<h3 class="sub-headline">Drive High-Impact Execution</h3>
<p> A great strategy is nothing without execution. I specialise in bridging that gap, leading cross-functional teams to deliver on your roadmap. I have extensive experience improving processes to reduce time-to-market, like when I cut time to market for new features to a maximum of 6 weeks. </p>

<h3 class="sub-headline">Lead and Mentor Your Product Team</h3>
<p> Whether you have a junior team that needs guidance or you're looking to build a product function from the ground up, I can provide leadership. With over 5 years of leadership experience and scaling teams at News UK, FutureLearn & Atheneum I can mentor your current team, hire key roles, and establish a thriving product culture </p>

<h3 class="sub-headline">Launch New Products (0 to 1) or Optimise Existing Ones</h3>
<p> I have deep expertise in both creating new products from scratch and optimising mature platforms for growth. I can lead the discovery process for a new venture or dive into your data to find opportunities, as I did when I increased a subscriber base from 450k to 530k at The Times </p>

<h3 class="sub-headline">Unlock Growth with AI & Innovation Technology is moving fast</h3>
<p> I can help you identify and leverage new opportunities, including using generative AI to create transformative growth. In my current role, I'm delivering AI products that have already resulted in 32% efficiency gains. </p>

<h3 class="sub-headline">Navigate Complex Technical Challenges</h3>
<p>  With a background that includes engineering and leading major replatforming projects for brands like LEGO.com & Which?, I am adept at working with technical teams to overcome complex challenges and ensure technology choices serve the product and the user.</p>
