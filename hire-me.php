					<p>Are you a founder who needs to focus on the bigger picture, or a leader of a company that requires senior product expertise without the full-time commitment?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="service-intro">
					<p>I partner with businesses as a <strong>fractional product leader</strong> to install effective product strategies, lead high-performing teams, and deliver measurable results.</p>
					<p>My goal is to provide the strategic oversight and hands-on execution you need to move your product forward, exactly when you need it most.</p>

						<h2 class="section-title">How I Can Help You</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="section-content">
						<p>My experience is broad, covering everything from early-stage startups to scaling mature products in global organisations. Here's how I can apply that expertise to your business:</p>

						<div class="services-list">
							<div class="service-item">
								<h3>Shape Your Product Strategy & Roadmap</h3>
								<p>If you lack a clear direction, I can help define a compelling product vision that aligns with your business goals. We'll build and refine a product strategy and create an actionable roadmap that your entire team can rally behind.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="service-item">
								<h3>Drive High-Impact Execution</h3>
								<p>A great strategy is nothing without execution. I specialise in bridging that gap, leading cross-functional teams to deliver on your roadmap. I have extensive experience improving processes to reduce time-to-market, like when I cut time to market for new features to a maximum of 6 weeks.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="service-item">
								<h3>Lead and Mentor Your Product Team</h3>
								<p>Whether you have a junior team that needs guidance or you're looking to build a product function from the ground up, I can provide leadership. With over 5 years of leadership experience and scaling teams at News UK, FutureLearn & Atheneum I can mentor your current team, hire key roles, and establish a thriving product culture.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="service-item">
								<h3>Launch New Products (0â†’1) or Optimise Existing Ones</h3>
								<p>I have deep expertise in both creating new products from scratch and optimising mature platforms for growth. I can lead the discovery process for a new venture or dive into your data to find opportunities, as I did when I increased a subscriber base by 18% at The Times.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="service-item">
								<h3>Unlock Growth with AI & Innovation</h3>
								<p>Technology is moving fast. I can help you identify and leverage new opportunities, including using generative AI to create transformative growth. In my current role, I'm delivering AI products that have already resulted in 32% efficiency gains.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="service-item">
								<h3>Navigate Complex Technical Challenges</h3>
								<p>With a background that includes engineering and leading major replatforming projects for brands like LEGO.com & Which?, I am adept at working with technical teams to overcome complex challenges and ensure technology choices serve the product and the user.</p>
