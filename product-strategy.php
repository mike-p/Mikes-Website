                    <p>A product review process as the titles suggests is a framework for shipping products that have a clear strategy, vision and measurable impact.  This is a scalable approach that can be used across squads and tribes.</p>
                    <p>This is a living document that has been used in various guises at different companies.  It is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the needs of the business.</p>
                    <p>A note of caution, I've seen these also be very disruptive and essentially cause the complete opposite of what they are designed to do.  If you are going to implement something like this, please ensure that it is a collaborative approach and not a top down mandate.</p>
