			<h4>Mystery Dining</h4>
			<p>
			In the evenings I don my spy uniform and become a mystery dinner.  This involves visiting well known restaurants and sitting down to a lovely meal; after which a report is written up on all aspects of the restaurant - service, appearance, food, atmosphere and whether would personally you recommend it.  I generally do this twice a month but unfortunately I can’t tell you where or when...otherwise it wouldn't be a mystery...</p>
			
			<h4>Cooking</h4>
			<p>Whilst not a very good cook I do very much enjoy spending the time trying to perfect a green curry and various other forms of spicy food.</p>
			
			<h4>Snow</h4>
			<p>Having being very fortunate and introduced to the snowy slopes of Europe at a young age I thoroughly enjoy skiing.  In my late teens I dabbled with a snowboard but quickly found out that I wasn’t cool enough so stuck with the ski’s and poles.</p>  
			
			<p>On my travels in South America I was introduced to climbing up mountains - whilst nothing too technical I managed to summit a couple of mountains with some spectacular views.

			<h4>Photography</h4>
			<p>In no way do I really posses a great ability, more quantity and sometimes a good bit of luck.  These moments of luck (and unluck) can be found on my Flickr account.</p>
			
			<h4>World wide web</h4>
			<p>My first experience of the Wild World Web was back in '97 with the good old AOL 2.5.  From then on I’ve been hooked on the possibilities it brings.  Having been brought up on 28.8 modems and the lovely Netscape 4 I have watched all technologies (connection, browsers, web technologies) progress to where we are today.</p>
