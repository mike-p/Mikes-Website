                    <p>It has been a hugely positive step - as can be seen with what has been created:</p>

   					<h3 class="sub-headline">Workflow changes</h2>
                    <p>I brought in vibe coding as part of our discovery process - and it is discipline agnostic i.e. product managers, product success, product design all have a go.</p>
                    <p>We have been able to create a number of prototypes that have been used in user testing and also as part of pitches to senior stakeholders.</p>

					<h3 class="sub-headline">Impact</h2>
					<p>We have seen a marked improvement in the quality of our discovery work - and more importantly the engagement from the wider organisation.  It has also increased the ceiling on ambition.</p>
					 <h3 class="sub-headline">What's the catch?</h2>
					 <p>The main area of concern we encountered thus far is prototyping features that just aren't possible in the short term - and so we always had an open dialogue with engineering to make sure we weren't promising the moon on a stick!</p>
