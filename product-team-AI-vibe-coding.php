				<div class="intro">
					<p>Vibe coding is transforming how product teams approach discovery and prototyping. Here's what I've learned implementing it across product management, design, and success teams. <a href="/work">See my product leadership experience</a>.</p>

								<h3>Workflow Changes</h3>
								<p>I brought in vibe coding as part of our discovery process - and it is discipline agnostic i.e. product managers, product success, product design all have a go.</p>
								<p>We have been able to create a number of prototypes that have been used in user testing and also as part of pitches to senior stakeholders.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="service-item">
								<h3>Impact</h3>
								<p>We have seen a marked improvement in the quality of our discovery work - and more importantly the engagement from the wider organisation. It has also increased the ceiling on ambition.</p>
							</div>

							<div class="service-item">
								<h3>What's the Catch?</h3>
								<p>The main area of concern we encountered thus far is prototyping features that just aren't possible in the short term - and so we always had an open dialogue with engineering to make sure we weren't promising the moon on a stick!</p>
