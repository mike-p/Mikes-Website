# Part 1 — Foundations of a Better Job Hunt

_Draft for mike-p.co.uk/journal_

## 1. Nail Your 2-Minute Elevator Pitch

This was the single most valuable asset throughout the entire job search. A tight, confident, well-paced 2-minute intro set the tone for every conversation. When this was right, everything else flowed naturally.

Your elevator pitch becomes:

-   your opening statement,
-   your narrative anchor,
-   your first impression,
-   the thing recruiters remember when they're scanning dozens of candidates.

Get this one thing right and the whole process becomes easier.

## 2. Keep Your Motivation Simple

Almost every recruiter asked some variation of _"What's motivating the move?"_ The best answer was always the simplest. For me, it came down to:

**I want to work with great people who care about building great products.**

That's it. No long backstory. No complex explanation. Simple is memorable.

---

## 3. Enthusiasm Goes Further Than You Think

One of the biggest lessons: people respond far more to energy than credentials. Showing genuine interest and positive intent consistently made conversations better. Enthusiasm builds momentum.

---

## 4. Your Website Is a Superpower

Being able to say "there's more detail on my site" saved time and made conversations smoother. It acted as a living portfolio—easy for recruiters to reference, easy for hiring managers to skim, and a great way to show product thinking without sending attachments.

---

## 5. Re-Using My Product Approach Deck Was a Huge Advantage

I had an existing deck that explained my product philosophy and how I work. Being able to reuse it—and iterate it—was incredibly helpful.

Instead of reinventing the wheel, I refined something I already believed in. It gave structure to conversations, served as a leave-behind, and acted as a visual reinforcement of how I think.

If you already have something like this, reuse it. If not, build it early.

## 6. Define Your Scope Early (It Saves a Lot of Wasted Calls)

I spent time clarifying whether I was open to:

-   full-time roles,

-   contract work,

-   fractional leadership,

-   IC vs Head of Product.

One thing I learned: recruiters often blur titles. In your own work, _Lead_ meant IC and _Head_ meant managing PMs. Making this explicit saved a lot of confusion.

Define exactly what you want so you're not reacting to randomness.

---

## 7. Recruiters Do a Hard Job — and Most Were Brilliant

On the whole, the recruiters I worked with were generous with their time, honest, and genuinely helpful. They juggle a lot, and the more straightforward you make things for them, the better the experience on both sides.

**Special mentions: (names TBC).**

## Coming Up Next: Part 2 — The Reality of Interviews & What Actually Happens

Part 2 will cover:

-   how interviews actually unfold,

-   good and bad surprises,

-   pacing and momentum,

-   managing the emotional side,

-   what I'd do differently next time.
