-   **Product Strategy** = _“Where are we going, and why?”_ (1–3 year view)
-   **1-Pagers** = _“Which problems should we solve to get there?”_ (initiative-level bets)
-   **PRDs** = _“How do we execute the solution to those problems?”_ (feature-level plans)
-   **Impact Assessment** = _“What did we learn”_
